## About this Repository

This repository contains sample Android, iOS, and ReactNative apps that make use of the iTwin Mobile SDK.

There are four iOS sample apps. All of them include a WKWebView running Typescript code to host the iTwin content.

- **MobileStarter** is a UIKit app containing a full-screen iTwin web view.
- **SwiftUIStarter** is a SwiftUI app that similarly contains a full-screen iTwin web view.
- **CameraSample** demonstrates how to make calls to native iOS code to take or select a picture.
- **ThirdPartyAuth** demonstrates how to use a third party for user authentication.

Each iOS sample app includes an Xcode project with a LocalSDK\_ prefix. These Xcode projects are the same as the main ones, with the exception that they refer to a local filesystem copy of mobile-sdk-ios, instead of referring to the mobile-sdk-ios Swift Package on GitHub. You must have mobile-sdk-ios checked out alongside mobile-samples in order for these to work.

There are three Android sample apps. All of them include an Android WebView running TypeScript code to host the iTwin content

- **iTwinStarter** is an app containing a full-screen iTwin web view.
- **CameraSample** demonstrates how to make calls to native Android code to take or select a picture.
- **ThirdPartyAuth** demonstrates how to use a third party for user authentication.

There is one React Native sample app:

- **iTwinRNStarter** is a React Native app with a WebView running TypeScript code to host the iTwin content.

See [iOS/README.md](./iOS/README.md) for instructions on building the iOS samples.

See [Android/README.md](./Android/README.md) for instructions on building the Android samples.

See [ReactNative/README.md](./ReactNative/README.md) for instructions on building the React Native sample.

See [OFFLINE.md](./OFFLINE.md) for information about using iModels while offline.

## Sample iModels

The `Snapshot iModels` directory contains sample snapshot iModels that can be copied onto the device to be opened from the apps. Right now, there is only one sample: `Building Blocks.bim`. On a Windows PC, you can use iTunes to copy the file to an iPhone or iPad, and on a Mac you can use Finder. You can use the Device File Explorer in Android Studio to copy the file to an Android device. Once it has been copied to the app's documents directory on the device, it will show up in the Local iModels screen of the app. If you are already on that screen while you copy the file, hit the refresh button in the upper right to refresh the list. If you copy the file to a system directory on the device instead of the app's documents directory, you can use the `Choose File...` button on the Local iModels screen.
