# iTwin Mobile SDK React Native Sample

This React Native sample works like the [iOS](../iOS/README.md) and [Android](../Android/README.md) samples, with a few differences.

## React Native App NPM Setup

1. You must install node 18 on your computer, and it needs to be the default node found in your path.
1. Run a Command Prompt/Terminal.
1. cd into the `ReactNative/iTwinRNStarter` directory of this repository.
1. Run `npm install`.

## Running the iOS Sample

1. Run Terminal.
1. cd into the `ReactNative/iTwinRNStarter/ios` directory of this repository.
1. Run `pod install`.
1. Follow the iOS samples instructions [here](../iOS/README.md). __Note__: Instead of opening the xcodeproj for the React Native sample, you _must_ open the xcworkspace. The workspace file is `ReactNative/ios/iTwinRNStarter.xcworkspace`.

## Running the Android Sample

Follow the Android samples instructions [here](../Android/README.md). The Android sample is in `ReactNative/android`.
