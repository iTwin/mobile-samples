# ThirdPartyAuth

This sample demonstrates using an iTwin service app so that an iTwin Mobile app can make use of a 3rd party authentication provider. It uses [auth0](https://auth0.com/) for user authentication, signing into an account set up there using native SwiftUI to obtain an ID token. It then uses that ID token as the authentication when communicating with a demo iTwin token provider server running on the developer's Mac. The token provider server validates that the token is from the proper auth0 domain, and then uses a client secret that was created during the registration of the iTwin service app to generate an iTwin access token.

If you want to run the sample, you will need to set up an auth0 account and configure it to work with this sample. However, while this sample uses auth0, the 3rd party authentication workflow should work the same with any authentication provider. Specifically:

1. Have the user sign in and get a token.
1. Automatically refresh this token as needed.
1. Use this token in the `Authentication` header sent to a custom iTwin access token provider.
1. Create a web service app that runs on a server somewhere.
1. Have this app validate the incoming token to decide whether the user is authorized, and if so to what extent.
1. Return an iTwin service access token based on your authentication of the user.

## Setup

1. Follow the instructions in the [iOS Readme](../README.md).
1. Create an client on [auth0](https://auth0.com/).
1. From the auth0 dashboard, select the drop-down in the top left and then select "Create tenant".
1. Use itwin-mobile-sample as the tenant name. The other settings should be good with their default values (auto Region and Environment Tag of Development).
1. Hit Create.
1. Select Application from the sidebar.
1. Create Application.
1. Name the application ThirdPartyAuth.
1. Make sure Native is selected as the application type and hit "Create".
1. In the application settings, scroll down to "Allowed Callback URLs".
1. Enter the following URL:

    `com.bentley.sample.ThirdPartyAuth://itwin-mobile-sample.us.auth0.com/ios/com.bentley.sample.ThirdPartyAuth/callback`

    _Note:_ You may have to change `.us` to something else if your region isn't U.S.
1. Enter the same URL in the "Allowed Logout URLs" box.
1. Scroll to the bottom and hit "Save Changes".
1. Add the following environment variables to you ITMApplication.xcconfig file and configure them to match the above auth0 client:
    ```
    ITMSAMPLE_TOKEN_SERVER_URL
    ITMSAMPLE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
    ITMSAMPLE_AUTH0_DOMAIN
    ITMSAMPLE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE
    ```

    _Note:_ If the value in ITMSAMPLE_TOKEN_SERVER_URL points to your local network, iOS will prompt you for permission to access the local network the first time you run the app. If you do not allow it to do so, iModel downloads will fail.
1. Follow the instructions in the [Token Server Readme](../../cross-platform/token-server/README.md).
1. Open ThirdPartyAuth.xcodeproj.
1. Run.
1. Hit Log in
1. Select "Sign up" and create an account.
